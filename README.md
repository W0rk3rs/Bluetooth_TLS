# Bluetooth_TLS

## Overview

Welcome to our project! This repository is structured with three distinct branches, each dedicated to a specific component of our system. This README will guide you through the purpose of each branch and how to work with them.

## Branches

### 1. `server_c`
This branch contains all the server-side code written in C. The server is responsible for handling requests, managing data, and ensuring the overall functionality of the backend.

### 2. `client_c`
This branch contains the client-side code written in C. The client is responsible for interacting with the server, sending requests, and processing responses.
   git checkout server_c

### 3. `android_app`
This branch contains the Android application code. The application integrates a Java client for Bluetooth TLS, allowing secure communication over Bluetooth.

**To Checkout the Branch:**

   git checkout <branch_name>
